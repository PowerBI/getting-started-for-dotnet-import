The sample shows you how to use the **Create Import** operation to upload a PBIX file to Power BI. This allows you to take a package of content in a PBIX file, and import it into a Power BI workspace. The **Imports** API splits the PBIX package into its individual parts including datasets and reports. It will then provide a metadata link between the actual import operation and the objects that were created from it.
